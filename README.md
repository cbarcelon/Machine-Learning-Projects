# Machine-Learning-Projects
Projects I worked on from Udacities Machine Learning Engineer NanoDegree.
Each project is it's own subdirectory.
There is an html copy of each project in it's completed form.  If you would like to run the projects use the jupyter notebook included.
The projects all have Jupyter notebook with a name corresponding to the project name. Include with each project is the files needed to run the project or links to download necessary files.
Enjoy!
