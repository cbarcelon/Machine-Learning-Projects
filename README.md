# Machine-Learning-Projects
Projects I worked on from Udacities Machine Learning Engineer NanoDegree.
Each project is it's own subdirectory.
The projects all have Jupyter notebook with a name corresponding to the project name. Include with each project is the files needed to run the project or links to download necessary files.
Enjoy!
